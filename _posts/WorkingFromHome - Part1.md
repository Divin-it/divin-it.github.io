# Working Remote
## Introduction
Some of you are already working quite a time now from home or remote together, so the process is not completely new anymore. So yes the Covid-19 outbreak was a big catalyst in regards to digitalization and how we work together.

I am a Scrum Master for two software developer teams. As the company I am working for, has different locations around the world and most of my team members are spread over India, Germany and the US, I was already working in a distributed & remote team for over two years. So from the start as a Scrum Master I had to learn and master supporting a distributed team. Some of these learnings we adapted to help our team and company in these difficult times as now most of our teams are working from home. I want to share with you a couple of these insights, so that they make your life hopefully a little easier.

## Overview
When I was writing this post I had more and more ideas and topics I wanted to talk about, so I decided to split the post in different parts:

1. Part one is about the different tools for messaging or video calls and a collection of practices you should adhere to when working in a distributed team or working from home.

2. Part two will be about online Meetings, their structure and some helpful meeting guidelines.

3. The next part will focus about what is sometimes easily overlooked - the people. What improvements are possible for them from a collaboration and human side. Here I will present a couple of ideas, which can help to make life a little bit easier and which should improve the mood.

4. The last part is an outlook with some food for though about the possibilities this situation now introduces in regards to New Work and how we work in general.

Stay tuned because there is more to come!


## Tools and Processes - Working Remote Part One
### How to communicate

The most important aspect of remote collaboration in a team is communication. Normally in the office you can quickly visit someone’s desk and discuss e.g. a problem. Nowadays this not possible anymore, so we use other means to communicate and exchange information.

Of course the tools to communicate were used before. Slack, Teams, Google Chat, Zoom and Skype are no strangers to most people. But and there is a big difference, they are now the only means of staying in contact. The direct human contact with all its nuances and important aspects of non-verbal communication	 are now completely absent.

What is now important when you are only using the digital communication channels?

*After this part we also look shortly into the different tools and their pros and cons.*

### Messaging and Emails
1. **Schedule** times when you check your messages and emails. The constant interruptions of incoming notifications are causing a hit to your concentration as you constantly have to switch between two topics. There are a lot of studies, which prove that this can have a big impact on your **productivity**. So split your time between working like coding or writing an article and answering Emails.
2. In your communication tool you should have a **dedicated channel** for goofing of. The trips to the coffee machine and your conversations are not happening anymore, so you need a replacement. This channel is there for funny pictures of your cat or anything else **not-work-related**, just have some fun.
3. This practice is always important but even more so in these times. If you are writing an email always think about who really has to be in the recipient list of the mail. The less emails your colleagues get the better they can work distraction free.

### Video Calls
1. The first and most important rule for video chats is **TURN ON your camera**. When it is not possible to see each other in person, the video stream of everybody helps at least to see some nuances of the non verbal communication. You can see much easier if somebody is paying no attention, has technical troubles or wants to say something. Lead by example with turning your webcam always on and ask others to follow you. Nobody has to look perfect in the call, but everybody profits by seeing the other participants.
2. As there is usually some latency involved, define some **talking rules**  in your team. For example set out the rule of raising your hand, when you want to say something, limit questions to the end or define a neutral person as moderator are some of the possibilities for the talking rules.
3. Invite only the smallest number possible to your video call. If the group is bigger than four persons you can separate the call in **smaller sub groups** or breakout sessions to have more productive sessions. During a video call it is much harder to speak or work simultaneous, so this method helps a lot with your productivity (In part two I will have some other rules and tips for meeting guidelines.) 

### Tools for Messaging and Video Calls
First one word of caution as you should always thrive to streamline your use of tools in your team or company. Investigate which tool suits most of your needs and then try to stick with it, because it can be very burdensome if the user is overwhelmed with the tool choices.

With this out of the way here are some tools/services recommendations, so that you can make an informed choice.

#### Messaging Tools
1. The most popular choice by far is [Slack](www.slack.com). It has a lot if interesting features like channels (grouping by topic), direct messages, video & voice calling and automation via bots. It runs very stable, has a broad toolkit and can integrate with a lot of other services.
2. The next one is [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), which is basically a direct competitor to Slack. It hast almost the same feature set, but is much more integrated with Office 365. So if you are already a Microsoft services user, this app could fit right into your workflow. Of course you can also voice & video call over this tool with group and single calls.
3. The last one is [Google Chat](https://chat.google.com/). I have to be honest, feature and usability wise Slack and Teams are much better than Google Chat, but it has one big advantage. Google Chat is a part of the Google Apps Suite and that is why you don‘t have to pay for another service. It is also integrated with the other Google services and everybody can use their Google account, which makes the setup pretty easy. So if you or your team is already using the Google Apps Suite, it is definitely worth a look.

#### Videocalling Tools
1. By far the most popular tool used today is [ZOOM](https://zoom.us/). Zoom supports everything from simple video calls to webinars and video calls with hundred participant. Although there were some discussions about Zooms security in the past weeks, it is still by far one of the most stable and powerful video calling tool. One of the absolut marquee features it has over its competitors, is the breakout rooms functionality. With the breakout rooms you can separate the currently ongoing video call into smaller subgroups, where everybody can talk without disturbance from other people and at the end you can merge everybody back to the main group. This feature is very powerful for moderating online meetings and working productively together.
2. The next big one is [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/) (rebranded from Hangouts Meet), which is also part of the Google Apps Suite. You can join via URL even if you have no Google Account. Now since May 2020 Google Meet is free for everybody. You can invite up to 100 participants. If you want to invite up to 250 participants and have longer meetings than 60 minutes, you can subscribe to the Google Apps Suite. After the latest update Google Meet also supports a grid view like Zoom. As a lot of people already have a Google (Gmail) account, the use of Google Meet is pretty straight forward.
3. [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) is a combination of messenger, group and video calling tool. The biggest competitor to Teams is SLACK, but colleagues of me pointed out that the call and video quality of Teams is superior to Slack. Microsoft is also heavily investing and improving Teams, so you can keep an eye on this tool. The big advantage for Teams is the integration of powerful chat, video, calling capabilities and the deep integration with Office 365.

This was an overview over some of communication tools, which I found helpful in the past weeks, some practices to improve your communication and in the upcoming part two I will talk about online meetings and how to improve them. See you soon!
